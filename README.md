1. Explored the Data Thoroughly: I started with an in-depth analysis of the dataset, using visualizations like to uncover trends and patterns.

2. Cleaned & Transformed the Data: I made sure the data was tidy and ready for modeling â€” that included handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling where needed.

3. Built a Predictive Model: I used a Regression / Classification / Clustering approach to develop a model tailored to the problem at hand.

4. Made Predictions: Once the model was trained, I used it to generate predictions and test its performance on unseen data.

5. Evaluated the Results: I evaluated how well the model performed using appropriate metrics and shared insights on what could be improved.
